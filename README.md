# rock-friend
ITP 404 - Hal Pan 2018

Rock Friend generates random rocks and allows users to customize their own rock.
The home page will be the automatic random generation of the creature.
The about page will help explain to the user how to make the site and it's goals
The custom page will allow the visitor to create a monster with their own parameters.
The collection will display the monsters the visitor has made and will also allow them to view and edit the monster.

This site uses the Ember spectrum color pick addon:
